# winter.io
A Minimalistic, Adaptive HTML Template for A Personal Website.

[Demo](https://andypalan.com/winter.io)


This basic template is mobile-friendly and works well across devices of all sizes. It has thus far been largely used for academically-inclined personal websites, but can easily be adapted for other uses.

## Quick Start

To get started, choose one of the two following options:

1. Download the file `winter.io.zip`
2. Clone the git repo -- `git clone https://github.com/malayandi/winter.io`

Either option will give you all the required files.

## Main Contents

1. `index.html` The landing page.
2. `generic.html` A generic page containing various paragraph and list styles.
3. `generic2.html` A second generic page for time-organized data. In the template, this page is used in the context of teaching. Other use-cases include listing publications.
